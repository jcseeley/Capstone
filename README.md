# Research & Planning Log
8 AM to 11:30 AM - Discussed MVP, page layout, and stretch goals with client.

MVP:
  1) pictures and descriptions of each property - header? cards?
  2) import vrbo calendar for each listing - skip if too difficult
  3) guest information: *no sensitive info! - lockbox, address, directions, internet access*
    - post booking information - cancellation, refunds, overnight occupancy policy, pets, amenities
    - check in information - internet issues, cell service/landline info, shoes policy
    - grocery stores and restaurants
    - checkout info
    - contact and emergency info
        
        Utah Specific:
        - neighbors
        - directions / low water crossing
        - house - house rules - kitchen counter, barbecue, electrical blower, mice, trash/recycle
        - house - heating, cooling, and fireplace
        - barn - house rules - stove, bbq 
        - barn - heating, cooling, woodstove
        - guided hikes and canyoneering
        - hikes from the house - cream cellar road, phipps
        - extra help / contact - doug on site and katie contact info

        Sedona Specific:
        - post booking - all above + other unit on property, internet issues, trash/recycle, landscaper, wildlife
        - parking - studio vs house
        - house - laundry room, heating, cooling, fireplace
        - studio - natural wood, no kitchen / hotplate policy, heating, cooling, fireplace
        - guided hikes

Stretch Goals:
  - 1) react native app - geo location for restaurants, hikes, stores, etc.
  - 2) contact for potential booking / benefits of booking directly 
  - 3) ability to block off calendar dates and place deposit - venmo / ACH payments?
  - 4) add logins for property - display sensitive info - lockbox, address, directions, internet access
  
11:30 AM to 2 PM - Research Firebase - the lessons in LHTP are outdated and nothing is working. Trying to find a webpack config that actually works.
1:45 PM - *Found working packages!*

2 PM to 2:45 PM - Add base files to project, drew first draft of component diagram and started researching how to incorporate ICAL into project.

2:45 PM to 4:10 PM - Researched ICAL integration.

4:10 to 4:45 - Capstone Proposal

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
